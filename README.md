Washing hands is the only way to keep the virus out and take action properly to take control of novel epidemic COVID 19.

## About Me
Before explaining about my project UI design, let me introduce myself and why I started this project.

I am Software Engineer(fullstack) and currently working in Japan.<br>
I am father of young princess:princess: who is still 10 months old(while I am writing this ReadMe).<br>
I have no idea how to help people to be safe and there is nothing much I can do except from washing hands everyday and everytime.
(I still have to go to work place while I started this project and all I can do is washing my hands to keep myself and my family safe)

COVID19 is new disease and flutter is as new as COVID19 for me.<br>
So I started to think of making this app idea come up from no where and wanted to make self-awareness as well as for others.

That's all folks, I am just a normal geek who is trying to make an app which can help people alittle bit for raising their awareness.

## Explanation about UI
ToDo

## Architecture Design
 - Client: Mobile App (android/IOS)
 - Server: GraphQL Server with Social Media Authentication
 - Services/Tools: Firebase(cloud), AWS_AppSync, AWS_lambda, Flutter, GraphQL, DynamoDB

## Goal
Just simple.Complete project. Realease it.Spread the app to make people wash their hands.<br>It doesn't matter whoever release the similar app with the same idea before me. After all, this idea is to help people around the world to make awareness to wash their hands.
